    <h1>Margherita Pizza Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/margherita-pizza.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Margherita pizza is a timeless classic that celebrates simplicity and flavor in every bite. With its thin, crisp crust as a foundation, it's topped with a rich, tangy tomato sauce made from sun-ripened Italian tomatoes. Creamy slices of fresh mozzarella melt into golden pools, blending perfectly with the sauce, while vibrant green basil leaves add a fragrant herbal note. The final drizzle of extra virgin olive oil enhances the ingredients without overpowering them. Each bite is a perfect harmony of textures and tastes — warm, savory, slightly sweet, and unmistakably fresh. It’s a delicious reminder that sometimes, the simplest things are the most satisfying.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients for dough</h2>
    <li>
        <ul>2 cups all-purpose flour (or 00 flour for a more authentic texture)</ul>
        <ul>¾ cup warm water</ul>
        <ul>1 tsp active dry yeast</ul>
        <ul>1 tsp sugar</ul>
        <ul>1 tsp salt</ul>
        <ul>1 tbsp olive oil</ul>
    </li>
    <h2>Ingredients for topping</h2>
    <li>
        <ul>½ cup tomato sauce (preferably made from San Marzano tomatoes)</ul>
        <ul>150g fresh mozzarella cheese (sliced or torn into pieces)</ul>
        <ul>Fresh basil leaves (a handful)</ul>
        <ul>1 to 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</ul>
        <ul>Salt (to taste)</ul>
    </li>
    <p>Optional: A pinch of oregano or a sprinkle of Parmesan for extra flavor (though purists might skip this).</p>
    
    <h2>Steps to make dough</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes until frothy.</ol>
        <ol>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a rough dough forms.</ol>
        <ol>Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</ol>
        <ol>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm spot for 1 to 1½ hours or until doubled in size.</ol>
        <ol>Punch down the dough to release air. On a floured surface, stretch or roll it into a 12-inch circle. Place on a baking tray or pizza stone.</ol>
    </li>
    <h2>Assembly and baking</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>Preheat to 250°C (480°F) or as high as your oven goes. If you have a pizza stone, preheat it too.</ol>
        <ol>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce evenly over the base, leaving a small border around the edges.</ol>
        <ol>Distribute the mozzarella pieces evenly over the sauce.</ol>
        <ol>Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</ol>
        <ol>Remove from the oven. Add fresh basil leaves and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.</ol>
        <ol>Slice and enjoy immediately while hot and melty!</ol>
    </li>
